            One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
            himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
            armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see
            his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
            sections.

            The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide
            off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size
            of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's
            happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream.

            A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa
            was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that
            he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a
            nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and
            fur boa.
